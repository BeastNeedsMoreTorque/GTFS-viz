## About

This Ruby script is used to convert a set of [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference) files into a SQLite database + GeoJSONs needed by the [Transit Simulator](https://github.com/vasile/transit-simulator) web application that animates vehicles on a map based on timetables and network.

The script was tested on OSX machines with Ruby 1.9.x

## Install

- clone / download the copy of the repo on your machine
- install required Ruby Gems

		# (sudo) gem install json sqlite3 fusion_tables rake

## Setup

- create a folder inside **./gtfs-data** and name it with your project information (i.e. **usa-san-francisco-muni**)
	- the newly created folder inside gtfs-data should contain letters, digits, +, - characters only
- get a GTFS dataset and unzip-it inside the folder that you just created (i.e. )
	- not sure where to get one ? Check http://www.gtfs-data-exchange.com/
- edit the Rakefile and change the PROJECT_NAME variable with the folder name

For example this is how the [SFMTA GTFS](http://www.gtfs-data-exchange.com/agency/san-francisco-municipal-transportation-agency/) data looks on the local folder - http://screencast.com/t/5V2q2QZP9W7

## Import

The following Rake Tasks sequence need to be executed. 

	rake setup:init
	
	rake parse:shapes_2_geojson
	rake parse:stops_2_geojson
	rake parse:gtfs_2_kml
	
	rake parse:gtfs_2_sqlite
	
	rake parse:stops_interpolate
	
	rake parse:stops_trips_update
	
	rake project:deploy
	rake project:update_fusiontables
	
	rake project:update_settings_ft
	rake project:update_settings_map
	rake project:update_settings_routes
	rake project:update_name

Now you can access the transit simulator in browser and anjoy the animation :)
	
**TODO - add a detailed description about each task and execution times for SFMTA project.**
