## About

This Ruby script is used to convert a set of [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference) files into a SQLite database + GeoJSONs needed by the [Transit Map](https://github.com/vasile/transit-map) web application that animates vehicles on a map based on timetables and network.

The script was tested on OSX machines with Ruby 1.9.x

## Install

- clone / download the copy of the repo on your machine
- install required Ruby Gems

`bundle install`

## Setup

- create a folder inside **./gtfs-data** and name it with your project information
  - the name of the folder can contain letters, digits, +, - characters only
- in this folder unzip the GTFS dataset
  - not sure where to get GTFS data ? Check http://www.gtfs-data-exchange.com/
- edit the Rakefile and change the PROJECT_NAME constant with the folder name, i.e. **sfmta**
- you are ready to parse the GTFS data if you have this [folder structure](http://screencast.com/t/E78YDBuE) and running `rake -T` shows the available tasks: http://screencast.com/t/9bt3i3lfL


## Parse GTFS data

In a terminal window run the following Rake tasks:

	cd /path/to/GTFS-viz

	# Initialize folders and the SQLite DB
	rake setup:init	
	
	# Fill the DB tables defined in ./inc/gtfs_mapping.yml
	rake parse:gtfs_2_sqlite
	
	# Generate GeoJSON files from shapes.txt and stops.txt
	# If the shapes.txt is missing from the GTFS dataset, generate one based on stops.txt
	rake parse:shapes_2_geojson
	rake parse:stops_2_geojson
	
	# Generate KML files from shapes.txt and stops.txt
	rake parse:gtfs_2_kml
  	
	# Find the position of the stops along the shapes, store them in ./tmp/sfmta/trips_shapes.json
	rake parse:stops_interpolate
  	
	# Update DB trips and stop_times
	rake parse:stops_trips_update

Check the contents of ./tmp/sfmta - http://screencast.com/t/V3r5TZBn0m
- gtfs.db - SQLite DB tables of calendar.txt, routes.txt, stop_times.txt, stops.txt, trips.txt
- gtfs_shapes.geojson, gtfs_stops.geojson - GeoJSON files of shapes.txt, stops.txt
- gtfs_shapes.kml, gtfs_stops.kml - KML (Google Earth) files of shapes.txt, stops.txt

## Visualize

You can open the GeoJSON files with [QuantumGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) or any other GIS software. Same with the KML files which can be visualized using Google Earth.

If you want to create an animation of the GTFS data you will need to

- download / clone the [Transit Map](https://github.com/vasile/transit-map) web application
- download / clone the [Transit Map Route Icon](https://github.com/vasile/transit-map-route-icon) PHP script
- edit Rakefile and change the `PATH_TO_APP_TRANSIT_SIMULATOR`, PATH_TO_SCRIPT_ROUTE_ICON constants

## Setup Fusion Tables API

- create a project under [API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
- enable `Drive API` and `Fusion Tables API` under APIs - [screenshot](http://take.ms/eBNt6)
- add a new Credential as `Service Account` and select `P12` as key type - [screenshot](http://take.ms/MrlKz)
- save the key as `client.p12` under `inc/fusion_tables/client.p12`
- copy the email address which is `complicated_string@developer.gserviceaccount.com` and assign it to `API_CONSOLE_EMAIL_ADDRESS` inside `Rakefile` - [screenshot](http://take.ms/bHy2f)

## Update Transit-Map project

- Download / clone the [Transit Map](https://github.com/vasile/transit-map) web application

- Edit Rakefile and change the `PATH_TO_APP_TRANSIT_SIMULATOR`

- In a terminal window run the following Rake tasks:
	
		# Populate FusionTables with shapes.txt and stops.txt
		rake project:deploy_fusiontables
  	
		# Copy the files needed by the Transit Map web application
		rake project:deploy
  
Now, you should be able to see some action in your browser :)
